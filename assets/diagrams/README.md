# DFC Bridge methodology diagrams

These diagrams make the non-visual parts of the DFC Bridge Contract visible:

- `dfc-bridge-coverage-map` — six completeness checks required for a design with no blind spots;
- `data-contract-pipeline` — the path from data origin and meaning to states, responsive behavior, and an accessible equivalent;
- `motion-scroll-storyboard` — an explicit scroll timeline with tracks and a reduced-motion fallback;
- `responsive-transformation` — a declared pattern change that preserves identity, state, semantics, actions, and focus;
- `delivery-lifecycle` — the closed loop from design to implementation, design QA, and accepted deviations.
- `auto-layout-gate` — the blocking Page Check boundary between manual coordinates and transferable native Auto Layout, including GROUP, absolute-layer, asset, and instance semantics.
- `section-scope-gate` — the selected-section DFC Bridge island inside a legacy page, with traversed, opaque, atomic, deferred, and scope-qualified outcome semantics.

The SVG files are the editable canonical sources. The PNG files are ready-to-use raster exports for surfaces that do not support SVG. Keep the `title` and `desc` elements in every SVG; localized documentation supplies additional alt text and captions.

The diagrams use only the DFC Bridge product palette. Do not introduce gradients, decorative shadows, or status colors that change the meaning of the brand mark.
