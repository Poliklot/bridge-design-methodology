**Designs that can cross the gap.**

BRIDGE is a target-independent methodology for making interface designs transferable: from Figma or any other design source into code, design systems, no-code tools, internal editors, or AI-assisted implementation pipelines.

Languages: [English](README.md) · [Русский](README.ru.md)

> **BRIDGE is not a tool and not a platform adapter.**  
> BRIDGE is the contract that makes a design understandable before anyone tries to implement it.

## Where to start

Do not read the documentation front to back. Choose your task:

| I want to… | Start here | Then use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| prepare a design for the first time | **[Designer quick start](docs/00-designer-quick-start.md)** | [BRIDGE by example](examples/README.md) |
| review a design before handoff | **[Preflight checklist](docs/08-preflight-checklist.md)** | [Common designer mistakes](docs/09-common-designer-mistakes.md) |
| resolve one specific question | **[Example catalog](examples/README.md)** | [Tag grammar](docs/13-tag-grammar.md) |
| build a validator or adapter | **[Transfer contract](docs/04-transfer-contract.md)** | [Validation and autochecks](docs/11-validation-and-autochecks.md) |

> **Recommended designer path:** quick start → matching example → checklist. The full specification is reference material, not a prerequisite.

## The name

**BRIDGE** means that the design is no longer an isolated picture. It becomes a bridge between intention and implementation.

The acronym is the methodology:

| Letter | Principle | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **B** | **Breakpoints** | Responsive states are explicit and comparable as one logical tree. |
| **R** | **Roles** | A layer role is clear from Figma structure, UI Kit metadata, or a required BRIDGE intent tag. |
| **I** | **Identity** | Logical elements keep stable keys and tree positions across breakpoints. |
| **D** | **Dependencies** | Links, modals, states, anchors, and actions are declared. |
| **G** | **Geometry** | Position, size, spacing, and text metrics are reproducible. |
| **E** | **Exceptions** | Assets, fixed heights, overflow, decor, and non-standard behavior are intentional. |

## Brand vocabulary

Use the name consistently:

- **BRIDGE-ready design** — a design that can be transferred without guessing.
- **BRIDGE Contract** — the structured data expected from the design.
- **BRIDGE Preflight** — the checklist before handoff.
- **BRIDGE Adapter** — a target-specific implementation layer.
- **BRIDGE Linter** — a future validator for design mistakes.
- **BRIDGE Exception** — an intentional deviation with an explicit reason.

The visual mark follows the same contract: six stable modules stand for the six BRIDGE principles and form one transferable identity. See the [brand system](docs/brand-system.md) for meaning, colors, clear space, and source assets.

Short formula:

```text
BRIDGE-ready = explicit breakpoints + stable responsive tree + declared intent
```

## Why BRIDGE exists

A design that should be transferred by humans, AI agents, or deterministic tools must be authored as a system, not as a visual sketch.

BRIDGE is not tied to any specific platform. It does not prescribe a particular framework, CMS, visual editor, runtime, or design-to-code tool. Target adapters may map the same contract to HTML/CSS, React, Vue, mobile UI, internal tools, or any other implementation surface.

## Core idea

BRIDGE separates two things:

1. **Figma metadata** — the technical truth of the design: node type, Auto Layout, hierarchy, constraints, positioning, component source, variants.
2. **BRIDGE intent tags** — product meaning Figma does not know by itself: page, route, section, link, action, field, modal, state, decor, asset, exception.

Designers do not duplicate technical properties by hand. They build proper structure in Figma and use tags only for transferable intent.

No accidental free-floating layers. No mystery buttons. No responsive versions that silently change content meaning or rebuild the element tree.

## Tooling

BRIDGE Assistant, the Figma helper plugin for this methodology, is maintained in a separate repository:

```text
bridge-figma-assistant
```

## Minimal example

```text
Home Page [page=home] [route=/] [bp=1200] [view=default]
  Hero [section=home-hero]
    hero-bg [decor]

    hero-copy
      hero-title
      hero-subtitle

    button-group
      email-link [href=mailto:sales@example.com]
      contact-cta [action=modal:contact-modal]

Contact Modal [modal=contact-modal]
  contact-modal-content
```
