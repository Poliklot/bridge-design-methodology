# Validation and autochecks

DFC Bridge should become comfortable because a designer can run a preflight check before handoff and see concrete, fixable problems. The methodology must therefore define not only advice, but also machine-checkable rules.

## Validation layers

1. **Syntax validation** — tags, boolean visual-intent/draft flags, optional tag values, keys, href/action syntax, breakpoint tags.
2. **Identity validation** — identity uniqueness, identity stability, breakpoint-neutral identity values, type stability, and correct exclusion of `[decor]`/`[asset]` flags from identity-tag counting.
3. **Responsive validation** — identity coverage, tree topology/cardinality, parent-child stability, visibility changes, visual-intent drift, content drift, order changes, breakpoint completeness.
4. **Structure validation** — page/section/content-container Auto Layout, forbidden non-asset GROUP nodes, wrappers, clipping, positioning intent, fixed heights, overlaps.
5. **Interaction graph validation** — href links, draft link/control markers, actions, targets, modals, states, forms.
6. **Content validation** — text equality, strict legal/price content, rich text, localization risk; skip product-content drift checks for text inside decorative/root asset visuals.
7. **Asset validation** — asset policy, native text misuse, export settings, focal points.
8. **Accessibility validation** — contrast risk, touch targets, labels, focusable states, decorative layers hidden from the accessibility tree.
9. **Adapter capability validation** — target-specific unsupported features.

## Automation levels

- **Automatic** — can be checked deterministically from extracted design data.
- **Heuristic** — can be detected with confidence, but may need designer confirmation.
- **Manual** — must be checked by a human, but the checklist should make it explicit.

## Report severity

- **error** — blocks DFC Bridge-ready status.
- **warning** — requires explanation or fix before serious transfer.
- **info** — useful context for implementers and adapters.

## Minimum validator pipeline

```text
extract design tree
  -> normalize names, boolean visual-intent tags, optional tag values, keys, and Figma metadata
  -> discover page roots among direct Figma-page children and through native Figma SECTION organizers only
  -> group roots by page, then by view, then by breakpoint
  -> build identity map and type map
  -> check optional identity-bearing values against current breakpoint names/widths
  -> compare responsive tree cardinality and parent identities only inside one page/view group
  -> compare visibility, sibling order, and visual-intent flags inside each parent
  -> compare product content across breakpoints, excluding decorative/root asset visuals
  -> classify page, section, generic content-container, primitive/leaf, component-instance, and opaque asset boundaries
  -> inspect native node type and layout mode; require Auto Layout and reject non-asset GROUP nodes
  -> validate exact-node absolute decor/overlay intent without treating [decor] as a structural exemption
  -> classify remaining wrappers and positioning intent
  -> build href/action-target graph
  -> inspect geometry, overflow, and fixed heights
  -> check assets and component states
  -> emit report with rule IDs, severity, location, and fix hints
```

Native Figma Sections are transparent only during page-root discovery. The validator does not inherit their names/tags, serialize them into the DFC Bridge page tree, or use them to suppress layout rules. It stops root discovery at ordinary `FRAME`/`GROUP` wrappers, then validates only the discovered tagged roots and their own subtrees.

## Check selected section

**Check selected section** is a separate audit mode for a new DFC Bridge section inside a legacy/non-DFC Bridge host. It must not run the page pipeline with fabricated metadata.

```text
read explicit selection
  -> resolve each selected node to its nearest own/ancestor [section=<stable-id>] boundary
  -> reject empty/untagged selection, a page root, mixed section ids, or a section below an inherited [asset] as Blocked scope
  -> deduplicate normalized roots; traverse only those roots and descendants
  -> treat [asset] as opaque, descendant INSTANCE as a trusted atomic boundary, and [decor] as traversed intent
  -> run local identity, syntax, structure, content, and internal-target checks
  -> compare only explicitly selected variants of one section when 2+ usable roots exist
  -> defer only references that require lookup outside selected roots plus file/page/integration concerns
  -> emit scope-qualified Ready, Partial, or Blocked plus a persistent coverage matrix
```

An editable `FRAME` or `COMPONENT` root receives full subtree inspection. A selected `GROUP` may be normalized so the report can emit the existing blocking `layout.group-outside-asset` finding; it cannot become Ready outside an opaque asset. If the normalized selected section root itself is an `INSTANCE`, it exposes only boundary evidence and the result is Partial. Ordinary descendant instances are trusted atomic boundaries: their internals are not applicable to this traversal and do not lower Ready. An exact `[section=id] [asset]` root is valid and opaque, so internal layout coverage is N/A. A section below a different asset ancestor is Blocked before traversal; inherited opacity is not an exemption. `[decor]` alone never stops traversal.

One normalized root declares one requested context and can be Ready when that declared context is clean. Absence of variants the user did not request is `not requested`, not Partial or a missing-breakpoint error. Two or more explicitly selected roots must share one section id; they become declared selected variants. A context label inferred from root/container width is marked inferred, and the validator never discovers neighboring legacy frames to manufacture coverage.

| Coverage class | Selected-section meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Local | The selected subtree can prove intrinsic tag/identity and action/href syntax, source structure, content evidence, targets inside the roots, and complete valid `http:`, `https:`, `mailto:`, or `tel:` href values. Incomplete/malformed external values are blocking, not Deferred. |
| Selected variants | Identity/type, logical tree/cardinality, parents, product text, and visual intent are compared only across explicitly selected usable variants. |
| Deferred | Internal routes/anchors and action/component/data targets requiring lookup outside selected roots, plus page root, page/view/route completeness, required page breakpoints, global uniqueness, host placement, page semantics, runtime, production accessibility, and WCAG conformance require separate evidence. |

Exact implemented rule IDs and applicability live in the [selected-section coverage manifest](../validator/section-check-coverage.json). Its exact union is tracked independently from Page Check and the two counts must not be added.

## Rule catalog overview

For `layout.section-missing-auto-layout`, automatic means a non-page FRAME or COMPONENT carrying `[section]` is present in the audited tree. A placed INSTANCE is atomic: Page Check neither resolves its source component nor emits a section-layout finding for the instance. Select and audit the editable source tree separately.

## Suggested report format

```json
{
  "methodology": "DFC Bridge",
  "status": "not-ready",
  "summary": {
    "errors": 3,
    "warnings": 8,
    "info": 4
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "ruleId": "interaction.modal-target-missing",
      "severity": "error",
      "nodeId": "contact-cta",
      "breakpoint": 320,
      "message": "Button references modal `contact-modal`, but no modal target exists.",
      "fix": "Create `[modal=contact-modal]` or change the action."
    }
  ]
}
```

For a section-scoped report, include the boundary and unfinished evidence rather than reducing everything to issue counts:

```json
{
  "methodology": "DFC Bridge",
  "mode": "section",
  "status": "partial",
  "scope": {
    "kind": "section",
    "rootIdentity": "checkout-summary",
    "boundary": "selected-subtree",
    "readinessClaim": "section-source-only"
  },
  "coverage": {
    "evaluated": ["local-structure", "local-syntax"],
    "notRequested": ["selected-variant-comparison"],
    "deferred": ["file-resolved-targets", "host-integration"]
  },
  "issues": []
}
```

`Ready` requires no errors, warnings/TODOs, selected-root source gaps, or deferred checks in the declared selected scope; trusted descendant instances and unrequested variants do not lower it. `Partial` has no blocking local error but retains a selected-root `INSTANCE`, an indistinguishable selected context, or another warning/deferred gap. `Blocked` means a missing/invalid tagged boundary, nested/mixed section roots, or a blocking finding. These labels never imply page, implementation, product, or WCAG readiness.

## Checklist modes

### Designer quick check

Use before showing the file to engineering:

- missing identities;
- missing actions;
- obvious fixed-height text;
- missing modal/state targets;
- changed mobile copy.

### Reviewer strict check

Use before approving a handoff:

- full rule catalog;
- edge-case checklist;
- state coverage;
- accessibility warnings;
- adapter capability notes.

### Adapter certification check

Use to prove that a target implementation path supports DFC Bridge:

- supported tags;
- supported actions;
- unsupported visual features;
- asset fallback behavior;
- responsive mapping rules.

## What should block handoff immediately

- Missing stable identity on important elements.
- Duplicate identities inside a breakpoint/view scope.
- Responsive trees compared across different `[view=...]` values. Each view is a separate responsive contract and is compared only across its own breakpoints.
- Breakpoint-specific optional identity value, for example `[control=button-reviews-box-375]` inside a `[bp=375]` root.
- Same identity used for different logical types.
- Page root has native Auto Layout disabled; zero/one child, `[asset]`, `[decor]`, or exception metadata on the page root does not suppress the rule.
- Page root carries `[asset]`; this is a separate blocker, does not create an opaque boundary, and does not stop descendant validation.
- Frame-built section has native Auto Layout disabled, unless that exact section is a legitimate opaque whole-visual `[asset]` with no live content flow.
- Generic Auto Layout-capable container has two or more visible meaningful direct flow children while Auto Layout is disabled.
- Figma `GROUP` exists outside an opaque `[asset]` subtree. Manual-layout plus reason documents a proposed deviation but does not suppress the structural error.
- Stable decorative/asset root identity missing on a required breakpoint.
- Responsive element tree cardinality or parent-child topology changes without a structural exception.
- Visual intent drift such as `sneg [decor] [asset]` on desktop becoming plain `sneg` on mobile.
- Final clickable element without known `[href=...]` or `[action=...]`; draft `[link]` / `[control]` markers are TODOs, not syntax errors.
- Invalid unknown href placeholder `[href=#]`; use `[link]` instead.
- Fake or placeholder `[route=...]` value; omit route until the production URL is known.
- Action target missing.
- Page root without route is a Draft TODO (`routing.page-route-missing`), not a blocker.
- Modal without close behavior.
- Text fixed height with no overflow policy.
- Dynamic text that relies on manual line breaks.
- Hidden keyed layers used as source of truth.
- Rasterized text without explicit reason.

## False positives are acceptable

A validator should prefer useful friction over silent failure. False positives are acceptable if the report explains how to mark an intentional exception:

```text
[bridge-exception=overlay] [reason=decorative-layered-composition]
```

The goal is not to forbid complex design. The goal is to make complexity explicit. Structural Auto Layout/GROUP errors remain reported even when `[bridge-exception=manual-layout] [reason=...]` is present; those tags provide evidence for a separate deviation-acceptance gate rather than a Page Check pass. `[bridge-exception=overlay] [reason=...]` may satisfy positioning intent for the exact absolute overlay node.
