# Page routing and views

DFC Bridge treats pages, production routes, anchors, and page/data states as first-class parts of the transfer contract. A design is not only a set of sections; it is a navigable product surface.

## Page identity and optional route

A page root always needs a stable `[page=...]`. A route is added only when the real production URL or route pattern is known.

Known route:

```text
contacts [page=contacts] [route=/contacts] [bp=1200]
contacts [page=contacts] [route=/contacts] [bp=320]
```

Draft route unknown:

```text
contacts [page=contacts] [bp=1200] [view=default]
contacts [page=contacts] [bp=320] [view=default]
```

Rules:

- `[page=...]` is the stable page identity.
- `[route=...]` is a production URL path, not a guess and not a placeholder.
- `[route-pattern=...]` is a real production route template.
- if the route is not known yet, omit it; the missing route is a Draft TODO, not a hard error.
- all breakpoints/views of one routed page share the same route when the route is known.
- route is unique across the site unless the page is an intentional route template.

## Route syntax

Recommended route forms:

```text
[route=/]
[route=/contacts]
[route=/catalog]
[route=/catalog/product]
[route-pattern=/catalog/:slug]
```

Rules:

- use `[route=...]` only for concrete production pages;
- use `[route-pattern=...]` only for real templates such as product detail pages;
- do not invent fake routes to satisfy a checklist;
- avoid trailing slashes except for root `/` unless the product explicitly requires them;
- route values are case-sensitive in the contract, but lowercase kebab-case paths are recommended.

## Page views

`[view=...]` describes a page/data state, not a component UI state.

```text
catalog [page=catalog] [route=/catalog] [bp=1200] [view=default]
catalog [page=catalog] [route=/catalog] [bp=1200] [view=empty]
catalog [page=catalog] [route=/catalog] [bp=1200] [view=loading]
catalog [page=catalog] [route=/catalog] [bp=1200] [view=error]
```

Common page views:

```text
default
empty
loading
error
filtered
not-found
unauthorized
success
```

Rules:

- every page should have `view=default`;
- dynamic pages and collection pages should define empty, loading, and error views when applicable;
- all views of the same page share `[page=...]` and the same `[route=...]` when the route is known;
- views may have state-specific content, but responsive breakpoints of the same view must not change content.
- responsive identity, type, parent, cardinality, and content checks run inside one view only; `view=default` is never compared as a responsive counterpart of `view=empty` or `view=error`.
- the breakpoint set is shared by the page contract: every declared view needs a root for every required page breakpoint.

## Bad page-state modeling

Do not model page states as fake pages or fake routes:

```text
catalog [page=catalog] [route=/catalog] [view=default]
catalog-empty [page=catalog-empty] [route=/catalog-empty]
```

Correct:

```text
catalog [page=catalog] [route=/catalog] [view=default]
catalog [page=catalog] [route=/catalog] [view=empty]
```

If the production route is unknown, keep one page identity and omit route:

```text
catalog [page=catalog] [view=default]
catalog [page=catalog] [view=empty]
```

## Sections and anchors

Addressable sections use `[section=...]` and `[anchor=...]`:

```text
contacts-faq [section=contacts-faq] [anchor=faq]
```

`[section=...]` is the reusable section/component contract. The human layer name may be page-specific:

```text
catalog [section=product-slider]
related-products [section=product-slider]
recommended-products [section=product-slider]
hero [section=home-hero]
```

In the first three examples, content/data differs, but an adapter can implement the block with one section component. `home-hero` is an example of a page-unique section.

Rules:

- do not write `Section /` in the layer name when `[section=...]` is present;
- `[section=...]` should stay stable across breakpoints of one page;
- the same `[section=...]` on different pages may have different headings, data, and content;
- anchors are unique inside one page route or page identity;
- the same section identity should keep the same anchor across breakpoints;
- anchors are part of navigation and should not be invented by implementation later.

## Links and href resolution

Known links use `href` as the only destination truth and do not need `[link=...]`:

```text
contacts [href=/contacts]
faq [href=/contacts#faq]
same-page-faq [href=#faq]
telegram [href=https://t.me/company]
```

If the destination is unknown, use `[link]`:

```text
contacts [link]
```

Do not use `[href=#]` as an unknown placeholder. `#faq` is a real same-page anchor; `#` alone is invalid.

Validator resolution:

```text
href=/contacts      -> page with [route=/contacts]
href=/contacts#faq  -> page [route=/contacts] + section [anchor=faq]
href=#faq           -> current page + section [anchor=faq]
href=https://...    -> external URL, no internal route required
```

If a target page is still missing its route because the design is in draft, route resolution can remain a TODO. Once `[route=...]` is present, it must be the production URL.

## View and breakpoint scope

Uniqueness scope for top-level page roots with known routes:

```text
page + route + bp + view
```

If route is unknown in draft, use:

```text
page + bp + view
```

Example:

```text
catalog [page=catalog] [route=/catalog] [bp=1200] [view=default]
catalog [page=catalog] [route=/catalog] [bp=320] [view=default]
catalog [page=catalog] [route=/catalog] [bp=1200] [view=empty]
catalog [page=catalog] [route=/catalog] [bp=320] [view=empty]
```

## Validator rules

A DFC Bridge validator should report:

- page root has no route as Draft TODO, not a hard error;
- route value is not a production URL/path when route is specified;
- duplicate concrete routes;
- same page identity uses different known routes across breakpoints;
- same page view is missing on required breakpoint;
- dynamic collection page has no empty/loading/error view;
- `[href=#]` is used as an unknown placeholder;
- internal href route does not exist when route data is known;
- internal href anchor does not exist;
- same-page anchor href has no matching section in current page;
- anchor is duplicated inside one page route/page identity;
- page state is modeled as a separate fake route.
