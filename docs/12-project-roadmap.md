# Status and roadmap

**Updated 14 August 2026.** DFC Bridge is a public, MIT-licensed methodology and open-source documentation/validator repository. The DFC Bridge Assistant plugin is publicly installable from Figma Community, but its implementation repository is private. Public installation does not imply public plugin source, issues, or release history.

## Current releases

| Product | Version | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DFC Bridge methodology and site | **0.11.6** | Concise trilingual entry path, simplified navigation and checks, practical designer guides, and stable advanced references. Contract/schema, tag registry, and validator artifacts remain compatible. |
| DFC Bridge rule catalog | **107 rules** | Explicit automatic, heuristic, and manual coverage across methodology surfaces. |
| DFC Bridge Assistant for Figma coverage snapshot | **Verified coverage** | Verified implementation contract for blocking source-structure checks, Section-organized page roots, page checking, and separately scoped **Check selected section**. Figma Community remains authoritative for the currently published installable build; implementation remains private. |

The methodology remains pre-1.0. Pin versions: the structured payload, schema, rules, and wording may change with documented methodology releases.

## Available now

### A complete transfer method

The canonical guidance covers:

- short design anchors and five-dimensional identity mapping;
- viewport/container responsiveness, fluid rules, and declared transformations;
- content, data displays, tables, grids, charts, provenance, formatting, and failure states;
- state machines, forms, async behavior, focus, URL/history, and recovery;
- motion, long-scroll scenes, reverse/re-entry, reduced motion, and fallbacks;
- WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility profile, RTL/bidirectional context, and target capabilities;
- design → contract → implementation → QA → deviation lifecycle;
- explicit open questions so an unknown is owned instead of becoming a blind spot.

### Structured contract and validation artifacts

Version 0.9 introduced the pre-1.0 [structured transfer contract](04-transfer-contract.md) and [JSON Schema](../validator/bridge.schema.json). Version 0.10 added blocking native Auto Layout and GROUP boundaries to source validation. Version 0.11 adds a typed selected-section boundary, legacy-host contract, explicit local/deferred evidence, and scope-qualified readiness. The repository also publishes:

- a canonical registry for the compact layer-tag grammar;
- English/Russian rule catalog;
- schema and example fixtures;
- methodology, Page Check, and selected-section coverage manifests;
- checks for localization, references, examples, coverage, and site content.

Structured metadata supplements Figma/source metadata and short tags. It is not a claim that a universal production adapter already exists.

### Publicly installable Figma helper

[Install DFC Bridge Assistant from Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1654485530503673254). The public coverage snapshot supports direct and native-Section-organized page roots plus a separate selected-section source check without a separate DFC Bridge account. Community publication is a separate manual step, so use that page to confirm which installable build is currently available.

The plugin's implementation/source repository, private issues, and internal release records are not public methodology resources. Use the public installation page for availability; use this repository for the public contract, rules, examples, and roadmap.

## Separate automation scopes

The rule catalog contains **107** rules. The public coverage snapshots record two non-additive checks:

- **Page Check:** an exact emitted-rule union of **42** ids—**40 automatic** and **2 heuristic**—in [Page Check coverage](../validator/page-check-coverage.json);
- **Check selected section:** an exact emitted-rule union of **26** ids—**24 automatic** and **2 heuristic**—of which 20 are local and 6 run only for usable explicitly selected variants, in [selected-section coverage](../validator/section-check-coverage.json).

Do not add the counts: the scopes overlap. The selected-section manifest also records page/file rules that it intentionally never emits and concerns deferred to separate file/integration evidence.

The remaining rules are not “missing errors.” Many require manual product, semantic, content, accessibility, target-capability, performance, or lifecycle judgment. The [methodology coverage manifest](../validator/methodology-coverage.json) makes automatic, heuristic, and manual ownership explicit.

Therefore:

- a clean Page Check result means only that its declared page-scoped checks passed;
- a Ready selected-section result means only that the selected section source is ready for its declared contexts;
- the full checklist, structured-contract validation, manual review, target QA, and deviation review remain required;
- automation must never claim that all 107 rules ran or that section-source readiness makes a legacy page/product ready.

## Known limitations

### Pre-1.0 schema compatibility

The 0.9 structured contract is usable and versioned but not frozen. Before 1.0, fields may evolve. Producers and consumers must pin `contractVersion`, reject unsupported shapes visibly, and migrate without losing stable identity/requirement links.

### No universal adapter

DFC Bridge defines target-independent intent and capability profiles. It does not yet ship one adapter that can generate production-quality output for every web, native, no-code, editor, and design-system target.

### Source-tool checks are intentionally scoped

Page Check operates on a selected page/root. Check selected section normalizes only explicit `[section]` selections, traverses no legacy siblings, and defers file/host-resolved dependencies. Complete valid external href values are authored-resolved; a selected-root `INSTANCE` is Partial, while ordinary descendant instances are trusted atomic boundaries. Neither mode can prove runtime data, browser history, screen-reader output, performance budgets, backend behavior, or production conformance. The remaining concerns require structured evidence and implementation QA.

### Representative examples are not exhaustive product decisions

The methodology defines how to record data, state, motion, accessibility, capability, and lifecycle decisions. Each product must still supply its own values, owners, supported targets, budgets, and safe fallbacks.

## Before 1.0

1. Stabilize the structured contract and publish a compatibility/migration policy.
2. Expand validator rules only where results can remain honest about automatic, heuristic, and manual evidence.
3. Add validated full fixtures for more platforms, data displays, stateful flows, motion, RTL, and capability profiles.
4. Define adapter certification: supported contract modules, fallbacks, deviations, and test evidence.
5. Maintain the public changelog and introduce decision records for methodology/schema/rule changes.
6. Continue measured pilots and document preparation cost, clarification reduction, defects, and accessibility outcomes.

## After 1.0

Potential work includes target-specific adapters, deeper source-tool inspection, design-system mappings, richer reporting, and ecosystem integrations. These remain proposals until scoped, owned, and published in a methodology release.
