# Accessibility profile

DFC Bridge targets **WCAG 2.2 Level AA** for final implementations. This profile turns that target into design, contract, implementation, and QA responsibilities. It does not claim that a Figma file alone can conform: conformance is evaluated on the complete product and all applicable [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) success criteria.

![DFC Bridge coverage from design evidence through implementation and accessibility QA](../assets/diagrams/dfc-bridge-coverage-map.svg)

*Design evidence, structured intent, semantic implementation, and user-facing tests are all required. No single layer proves accessibility.*

## Normative baseline

- Target WCAG version: **2.2**.
- Target level: **AA**, including every applicable Level A and AA success criterion—not only the items summarized here.
- Scope: complete pages and processes, responsive and localized variants, authenticated states, errors, overlays, embedded content, and supported platforms.
- Accessibility-supported technologies: declared by the implementation team and tested with representative browsers and assistive technologies.
- Stronger product requirements in this profile remain required even when a WCAG exception would technically apply.

Use [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) for expected widget interaction patterns. Prefer native platform semantics and controls; ARIA does not repair an unsuitable interaction model.

## Responsibility matrix

| Stage | Required evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Design | Reading order, names, labels, states, focus behavior, contrast, reflow, target size, alternatives, reduced motion. |
| Contract | Stable semantic roles/relationships, reaction focus and announcements, data equivalents, exceptions and owners. |
| Implementation | Native semantics, keyboard behavior, accessibility API exposure, preference handling, responsive behavior. |
| QA | Automated checks plus keyboard, zoom/reflow, screen-reader, contrast, motion, media, and task-based manual tests. |

Do not hand accessibility to the developer as an unspecified cleanup step. Do not treat an automated scan as proof of conformance.

## Semantics and reading order

A page contract identifies:

- one descriptive page title, document language, and language changes;
- landmarks for header, navigation, main content, complementary content, forms, and footer where appropriate;
- a logical heading hierarchy that describes sections rather than visual font sizes;
- lists, tables, quotations, labels, status, and relationships according to meaning;
- alternative text or an explicit decorative classification for images;
- meaningful DOM/accessibility order independent of visual positioning.

Use existing Figma structure, component source, stable names, `[decor]`, and structured accessibility metadata as evidence. Do not create flat tags for every HTML element. The target adapter chooses native elements while preserving declared semantics.

## Accessible names, labels, and descriptions

Every control and field has a programmatic name that matches or includes its visible label. Icon-only controls need an explicit stable name. Additional description connects instructions, units, constraints, error messages, and consequences without replacing the label.

Requirements:

- visible text is the default source of an accessible name;
- the same control keeps the same name across breakpoints and states unless its action changes;
- placeholder text is not a label;
- link text describes its destination in context;
- repeated “Learn more” links gain distinguishing context;
- status badges expose the status in text, not color alone;
- required fields and accepted formats are explained before failure;
- errors identify the field, cause, and correction when known.

A short `[a11y-label=...]` may clarify an icon-only link/control when the design source has no better property. Rich help, error, and relationship data belongs in the structured contract, not additional layer-name tags.

## Keyboard and focus

All functionality must be usable from a keyboard or equivalent sequential input without a trap. The contract defines:

- logical Tab order based on semantic structure;
- widget-internal arrow-key behavior when a recognized pattern requires it;
- visible focus style in every theme and state;
- initial and restored focus for dialogs, drawers, menus, route changes, validation, deletion, and dynamic updates;
- skip or bypass mechanisms for repeated blocks;
- focus visibility when sticky headers, cookie banners, overlays, or scroll containers are present;
- alternatives to drag, path-based gestures, hover, and pointer-only actions.

Do not use positive `tabindex` or visual order as a substitute for correct source order. At Level AA, focused components must not be entirely hidden by author-created content under [Focus Not Obscured (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#focus-not-obscured-minimum). DFC Bridge additionally requires intentional focus indicators rather than relying on uncertain browser/theme contrast.

## Visual requirements

The implementation must meet, at minimum:

- text contrast of **4.5:1**, or **3:1** for WCAG-defined large text;
- **3:1** contrast for essential user-interface components and graphical objects;
- information not conveyed by color alone;
- content usable at **200% text resize**;
- reflow without two-dimensional page scrolling at a **320 CSS px** equivalent width, except content that genuinely requires two-dimensional layout;
- no loss when users apply WCAG text-spacing overrides;
- support for portrait and landscape unless one orientation is essential;
- visible instructions that do not rely only on shape, color, sound, position, or sensory language.

Validate real rendered states, not token names. A color token called `accessible-blue` proves nothing against an actual background and opacity.

## Target size and pointer input

WCAG 2.2 AA [Target Size (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#target-size-minimum) requires pointer targets to be at least **24 × 24 CSS px** or satisfy one of its spacing/exception conditions. DFC Bridge recommends a **44 × 44 CSS px** activation area for primary touch controls and uses the 24 px criterion as the non-negotiable AA floor.

Also define:

- sufficient separation of adjacent destructive or high-frequency targets;
- cancellation/undo for down-event activation where applicable;
- a non-drag alternative for drag operations;
- a single-pointer alternative to multipoint or path gestures;
- labels that remain visible and operable at narrow widths and zoom.

Do not enlarge only the painted icon while leaving a tiny activation box.

## Forms, errors, and authentication

Forms follow the [state-machine contract](22-state-machines-and-reactions.md) and must provide:

- labels, instructions, purpose/autocomplete metadata where applicable;
- error identification and correction suggestions when known;
- an error summary and deterministic focus/announcement behavior for complex forms;
- review, confirmation, reversal, or checking for legal, financial, and data-changing submissions as required;
- preserved values after validation or server failure;
- no repeated entry of previously supplied information in the same process unless an allowed exception applies;
- authentication that does not depend only on a cognitive-function test, with password managers and paste supported.

A disabled submit button must not be the only indication that the form is incomplete.

## Dynamic content and async status

Loading, results, errors, background saves, connection changes, and other meaningful updates need visible feedback and, where appropriate, a polite or assertive live announcement. Declare:

- what is announced and when;
- whether existing content becomes busy, stale, or unavailable;
- how repeated updates are coalesced to avoid noise;
- whether focus stays in place or moves for a task-specific reason;
- how users discover inserted content;
- timeout extension, retry, and recovery controls.

Do not move focus merely to make a screen reader announce a status. Use a semantic status mechanism and preserve the user's place whenever possible.

## Data, charts, and complex visuals

Apply the [data and visualization contract](20-data-and-visualization.md). Tables preserve header relationships; charts and maps have names, summaries, non-color encodings, keyboard-reachable interactions, and access to underlying values through a table/list/download where appropriate. Decorative visuals stay out of the accessibility tree.

A complex image needs an immediate short alternative plus nearby or linked detail sufficient to obtain the same essential information. The [WAI complex-images tutorial](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/complex/) provides official patterns.

## Motion, time, flashing, and media

Apply the [motion contract](21-motion-and-scroll.md). Respect reduced-motion preference, preserve the task in a static fallback, provide controls for qualifying moving/auto-updating content, and never exceed the WCAG flash threshold.

For time limits, declare warning, extension, preservation, and re-authentication behavior. For prerecorded and live audio/video, provide the captions, audio description, transcript, media controls, and alternatives required by all applicable Level A/AA criteria. Autoplaying audio must be avoided or controllable under the applicable criterion.

## Responsive transformations

A responsive transformation must preserve:

- accessible name, role, value, state, and relationships;
- reading and focus order;
- keyboard and pointer task completion;
- errors, status, provenance, and help;
- access to content hidden behind disclosure;
- focus/history restoration when switching presentation.

A visual table-to-card or navigation-to-menu transformation is not semantic permission to remove headings, relationships, or actions. Test container-driven changes as well as viewport breakpoints.

## Direction, writing mode, and bidirectional content

Accessibility review must include supported `ltr`/`rtl` directions and writing modes, not only translated strings. Preserve logical reading and keyboard order; do not force it to follow visual mirroring. Test mixed-direction people names, phone numbers, dates, ids, code, and digits; appropriate icon mirroring; chart axes and category order; focus indicators; error placement; and announcements. Use logical start/end relationships and declare the base direction of embedded values so assistive technology receives an intelligible sequence.

## Structured accessibility metadata

Use structured metadata only for intent the source and components cannot express:

> **Non-standalone module fragment.** This excerpt shows only `bridge.accessibility` and intentionally omits required envelope fields. Insert it into the required `bridge` envelope from the [transfer contract](04-transfer-contract.md#required-envelope) before exchange or full-contract validation.

```json
{
  "bridge": {
    "accessibility": {
      "profile": { "standard": "WCAG", "version": "2.2", "level": "AA" },
      "elements": [{
        "element": "revenue-chart",
        "name": "Monthly revenue compared with target",
        "description": "Actual revenue exceeded target in 8 of 12 months",
        "details": "revenue-table",
        "readingOrder": ["chart-title", "chart-summary", "revenue-chart", "revenue-table"],
        "reducedMotion": "static-series",
        "testIds": ["a11y-chart-keyboard", "a11y-chart-values"]
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

This metadata supplements—not replaces—visible content and implementation semantics.

## Required QA matrix

At minimum, test representative complete tasks with:

1. keyboard only, forward and reverse order, including overlays and failures;
2. screen reader plus keyboard on the team's declared accessibility-supported platform combinations;
3. 200% text resize and 400% browser zoom/reflow at narrow equivalent width;
4. text-spacing overrides and long localization;
5. forced/high-contrast or platform contrast modes where supported;
6. reduced motion and disabled/non-supported preferred animation mechanisms;
7. pointer and touch target size, cancellation, gesture alternatives, and orientation;
8. automated rules for detectable failures, followed by manual review;
9. loading, empty, partial, stale, error, offline, validation, and permission states;
10. each declared responsive transformation.
11. supported RTL/bidirectional and writing-mode fixtures, including charts and mixed identifiers.

Record browser, platform, assistive technology/version, scenario, expected result, actual result, and evidence. Passing one screen reader/browser combination does not prove universal support.

## Exceptions and conformance claims

An exception record must identify the exact criterion or DFC Bridge requirement, affected scope, evidence, user impact, reason, owner, mitigation, approval, and review/expiry date. “Technical limitation” without evidence and a mitigation plan is not acceptable.

Do not claim WCAG conformance for a mockup, component in isolation, automated score, or incomplete journey. A release may claim conformance only after the implemented, complete scoped pages and processes have been evaluated against all applicable criteria and known failures are accurately disclosed.
