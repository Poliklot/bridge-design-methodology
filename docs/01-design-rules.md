# Design rules

DFC Bridge adds only the meaning that Figma does not already store. The file itself remains the source of truth for layout, size, style, hierarchy, and component data.

## 1. Do not repeat Figma

Do not put sizes, gaps, colors, layout direction, or component variants into layer names or tags. Add a tag only when it answers a product question: what page is this, what does it do, or what should be exported?

## 2. Build a clear structure

Use frames and components to express real relationships. A wrapper should have a job: content grouping, layout, clipping, background, or interaction area.

Keep the main flow in native Figma layout. A `GROUP` is not a content container; use it only inside a genuinely opaque `[asset]` subtree. The [wrapper guide](06-wrapper-policy.md) explains exceptions.

## 3. Give each root one context

A page root describes one page, state, and prepared width:

```text
home [page=home] [bp=1440] [view=default]
```

Use the same `[page]` and `[view]` for the other widths. A native Figma Section may organize the canvas, but it does not replace the page root or add page meaning.

## 4. Separate content, decoration, and export

- editable text, data, and images remain content;
- `[decor]` marks an exact intentional visual layer;
- `[asset]` marks a visual that is transferred as one resource.

Do not turn editable text into an image just to protect a composition.

## 5. Treat overflow as a decision

Text and data must survive realistic values, localization, and intermediate widths. If content clips, scrolls, truncates, or changes height, the intended behavior must be visible or recorded. See [height and overflow](07-height-and-overflow.md).

## 6. Keep components editable

Use the component from the correct library. A local instance may have page-specific content and action, but do not detach or hide old versions to make the file look complete.

## 7. Keep the method platform-independent

DFC Bridge describes intent, relationships, and constraints. It does not require a specific frontend framework. Implementation-specific details belong in the structured contract or the implementation record.

## Ready to hand over

The structure is ready when a person can find the page, widths, important relationships, actions, content policy, and open decisions without asking the author.
