# Motion and long-scroll contract

Motion is behavior over time. A transferable design must define its driver, states, timing, interruption, re-entry, and accessible fallback—not only a pair of attractive keyframes.

![Storyboard of scroll-driven scenes, transitions, and fallbacks](../assets/diagrams/motion-scroll-storyboard.svg)

*Describe the stable scenes first, then the transitions and the conditions that drive them.*

## Start with purpose and stable states

Every motion sequence must have a purpose: preserve spatial continuity, explain causality, direct attention, show progress, confirm an action, or tell a deliberate story. Decorative motion may not delay or obscure a task.

First design the meaningful states without animation:

```text
feature-story
  scene-intro
  scene-compare
  scene-result
```

Each state must be comprehensible as a still frame. Motion defines how the interface moves between those states. If content is meaningful only while it is moving, the fallback is incomplete.

## Declare the driver

| Driver | Examples | Contract requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Time | enter, exit, loop, progress | start condition, duration, delay, iterations, end state |
| User event | click, submit, drag, hover, focus | event, input parity, cancel/reverse behavior |
| Scroll | progress through a section or document | source scroller, range, axis, offsets, mapping, re-entry |
| View | element enters or leaves visibility | threshold, root, once/repeat policy |
| Media/data | playback time or live value | clock/source, buffering or missing-data behavior |
| System | route change, connection, preference | trigger, persistence, fallback |

Do not label a sequence merely “on scroll.” Specify whether scroll crosses a threshold, drives continuous progress, or selects discrete scenes.

## Timeline contract

For each transition or track, record:

- stable source and destination state identities;
- driver and trigger;
- affected property or semantic change;
- start/end values and units;
- duration or input range;
- delay, easing, iterations, and fill behavior;
- synchronization/sequence relationships;
- transform origin and coordinate space;
- behavior on cancel, interruption, resize, and content change;
- reverse and re-entry behavior;
- reduced-motion and unsupported-platform result.

Prefer animating transform and opacity when that preserves the intended geometry, but performance never overrides semantics, focus, or readable content. Motion tokens may define reusable durations and easing; a story sequence still needs its own state and driver contract.

## Keep rich motion out of layer names

Use ordinary stable identities in the design:

```text
story [section=feature-story]
  story-visual
  scene-intro
  scene-compare
  scene-result
```

Do not create a flat grammar of `[fade]`, `[duration]`, `[easing]`, `[pin]`, and `[scroll-start]` tags. Reference the identities from structured DFC Bridge metadata:

```json
{
  "bridge": {
    "motion": {
      "sequences": [{
        "sequenceId": "feature-story-scroll",
        "purpose": "Explain the product workflow in three steps",
        "driver": {
          "type": "scroll-progress",
          "source": "document",
          "range": { "start": "feature-story block-start 80%", "end": "feature-story block-end 20%" },
          "axis": "block"
        },

          { "id": "compare", "range": [0.32, 0.68], "content": "scene-compare" },
          { "id": "result", "range": [0.68, 1], "content": "scene-result" }
        ],

        "reducedMotion": "show-all-scenes-in-document-order"
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

CSS implementations can map appropriate cases to the [CSS Scroll-driven Animations specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/scroll-animations-1/); other targets may use another mechanism while preserving the same contract.

## Long-scroll stories

A long-scroll sequence defines:

1. **Narrative units:** scenes, their stable ids, and the meaning visible in each.
2. **Scroll source:** document or named container; nested scrollers must be explicit.
3. **Range:** start/end offsets and whether they use viewport or container coordinates.
4. **Mapping:** continuous progress, thresholds, snapping, or discrete scene selection.
5. **Layout:** reserved height, sticky/pinned region, and normal-flow content.
6. **Entry:** initial state when reached from above, below, an anchor, or restored history.
7. **Exit:** final state and cleanup in both directions.
8. **Mutation:** recalculation after resize, orientation, font load, localization, or dynamic content.
9. **Fallback:** readable normal flow when scripting, sticky positioning, or scroll timelines are unavailable.

Never assume forward-only scrolling. Scrubbing backward must reverse deterministically or jump to a declared stable state. Loading a deep link midway must not require the user to scroll from the top to initialize the scene.

## Sticky and pinned regions

Prefer native sticky behavior when it matches the design. The contract identifies the containing block, inset, start/end boundary, reserved flow space, stacking/collision policy, and behavior when the pinned object is taller than the available viewport.

Pinned presentation must not:

- reorder meaningful content in the accessibility tree;
- trap wheel, touch, or keyboard scrolling;
- hide focused controls behind headers or overlays;
- duplicate the same readable content into active and inactive copies;
- require a particular device height to reach the next section.

Use document order as the semantic and keyboard order. Visual layers may overlap it; they may not replace it.

## Re-entry, reverse, and interruption

For every sequence decide:

- **repeat:** once per session, once per view, or every entry;
- **re-entry:** restart, resume, derive from current driver, or remain completed;
- **reverse:** mirror the forward timeline, use another transition, or change immediately;
- **interruption:** complete, cancel, blend from the current value, or preserve progress;
- **rapid input:** debounce, queue, replace, or ignore—with a deterministic rule;
- **route/history restore:** reconstruct from URL, saved state, or current scroll position;
- **focus entry:** reveal the focused target immediately, without waiting for animation.

The implementation must never rely on an `animationend` event as the only way to reach a required product state: reduced motion, background tabs, and cancellation may bypass it.

## Reduced motion and fallbacks

DFC Bridge requires a reduced-motion design even when WCAG conformance alone would not force removal of every animation. Use the user's `prefers-reduced-motion` preference described by [CSS Media Queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-5/#prefers-reduced-motion).

For each sequence choose a real strategy:

- remove nonessential parallax, zoom, rotation, and large spatial travel;
- replace movement with an instant change or short cross-fade;
- stop automatic looping and expose a control when motion is essential;
- render long-scroll scenes in normal document order;
- keep progress, completion, focus, and target state identical.

“Reduce duration to almost zero” is not a complete strategy if scroll capture, flashing, pinned layout, or hidden content remains. With scripts disabled or APIs unsupported, all essential content and actions must still be present.

## Responsive motion

Motion follows the same-tree rule. Layout coordinates and path lengths may adapt; identities, purpose, state effects, and completion semantics remain the same.

If narrow presentation replaces a pinned story with a disclosure list or static sequence, declare a [responsive transformation](03-responsive-breakpoints.md): map every scene, preserve reading/action order, define focus and history behavior, and give both presentations the same reduced-motion outcome.

## Motion review gate

A sequence is ready only when reviewers can answer:

- What purpose does it serve and which stable states exist without it?
- What drives progress, and what are the exact ranges and timing?
- What happens on reverse, re-entry, rapid input, resize, and deep linking?
- Can users pause or stop moving content where required?
- Is meaningful order intact during sticky/pinned presentation?
- Does keyboard focus remain visible and land on an already rendered target?
- Does reduced motion preserve content, actions, state, and task completion?
- Does the fallback work without the preferred animation mechanism?

Apply the [WCAG 2.2 pause, stop, hide criterion](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#pause-stop-hide) and the [three flashes criterion](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#three-flashes-or-below-threshold) to every final implementation.
